# Smart Soil Moisture Logger Project – Ognjen Ostojić

## Project Goal
Design and implement a real-time system that monitors and logs soil moisture levels for various plants using an Arduino Uno, capacitive soil moisture sensor, and DS3231 real-time clock module. The system logs readings over time and visualizes them through Python-generated graphs, allowing analysis of moisture retention across different plant types.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v2.0
- DS3231 RTC Module
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires (male-male, female-male)
- USB cable (Arduino to PC)
- Python (for data logging and visualization)

---

## Observations
- **Beans** retained high moisture (~98–100%)
- **Lukovina** showed moderate drying over time
- **Narcis** maintained steady mid-to-high moisture
- **Red Plant** experienced the most variation due to different soil structure or exposure

---

## Conclusion
Different plants and soil types clearly affect moisture retention. The system reliably captured these trends and visualized them effectively, demonstrating both sensor accuracy and project utility.
